:mod:`~aioxmpp.bookmarks` â€“ Bookmark support (:xep:`0048`)
##########################################################

This module provides support for storing and retrieving bookmarks on
the server as per :xep:`Bookmarks <48>`.

Service
=======

.. currentmodule:: aioxmpp

.. autoclass:: BookmarkClient

.. currentmodule:: aioxmpp.bookmarks

XSOs
====

All bookmark types must adhere to the following ABC:

.. autoclass:: Bookmark

The following XSOs are used to represent an manipulate bookmark lists.

.. autoclass:: Conference

.. autoclass:: URL

To register custom bookmark classes use:

.. autofunction:: as_bookmark_class

The following is used internally as the XSO container for bookmarks.

.. autoclass:: Storage

Notes on usage
==============

.. currentmodule:: aioxmpp

It is highly recommended to interact with the bookmark client via the
provided signals and the get-modify-set methods
:meth:`~BookmarkClient.add_bookmark`,
:meth:`~BookmarkClient.discard_bookmark` and
:meth:`~BookmarkClient.update_bookmark`.  Using
:meth:`~BookmarkClient.set_bookmarks` directly is error prone and
might cause data loss due to race conditions.
