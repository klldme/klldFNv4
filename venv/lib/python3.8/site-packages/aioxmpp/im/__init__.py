:mod:`~aioxmpp.im` --- Instant Messaging Utilities and Services
###############################################################

This subpackage provides tools for Instant Messaging applications based on
XMPP. The tools are meant to be useful for both user-facing as well as
automated IM applications.

.. warning::

    :mod:`aioxmpp.im` is highly experimental, even more than :mod:`aioxmpp` by
    itself is. This is not a threat, this is a chance. Please play with the
    API, try to build an application around it, and let us know how it feels!
    This is your chance to work with us on the API.

    On the other hand, yes, there is a risk that weâ€™ll restructure the API
    massively in the next release, even though it works quite well for our
    applications currently.
