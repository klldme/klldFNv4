class AbstractConversation(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):

    Interface for a conversation.

    .. note::

       All signals may receive additional keyword arguments depending on the
       specific subclass implementing them. Handlers connected to the signals
       **must** support arbitrary keyword arguments.

       To support future extensions to the base specification, subclasses must
       prefix all keyword argument names with a common, short prefix which ends
       with an underscore. For example, a MUC implementation could use
       ``muc_presence``.

       Future extensions to the base class will use either names without
       underscores or the ``base_`` prefix.

    .. note::

       In the same spirit, methods defined on subclasses should use the same
       prefix. However, the base class does not guarantee that it wonâ€™t use
       names with underscores in future extensions.

       To prevent collisions, subclasses should avoid the use of prefixes which
       are verbs in the english language.

    Signals:

    .. note::

        The `member` argument common to many signals is never :data:`None` and
        always an instance of a subclass of
        :class:`~.AbstractConversationMember`. However, the `member` may not be
        part of the :attr:`members` of the conversation. For example, it may be
        the :attr:`service_member` object which is never part of
        :attr:`members`. Other cases where a non-member is passed as `member`
        may exist depending on the conversation subclass.

    .. signal:: on_message(msg, member, source, tracker=None, **kwargs)

       A message occurred in the conversation.

       :param msg: Message which was received.
       :type msg: :class:`aioxmpp.Message`
       :param member: The member object of the sender.
       :type member: :class:`.AbstractConversationMember`
       :param source: How the message was acquired
       :type source: :class:`~.MessageSource`
       :param tracker: A message tracker which tracks an outbound message.
       :type tracker: :class:`aioxmpp.tracking.MessageTracker`

       This signal is emitted on the following events:

       * A message was sent to the conversation and delivered directly to us.
         This is the classic case of "a message was received". In this case,
         `source` is :attr:`~.MessageSource.STREAM` and `member` is the
         :class:`~.AbstractConversationMember` of the originator.

       * A message was sent from this client. This is the classic case of "a
         message was sent". In this case, `source` is
         :attr:`~.MessageSource.STREAM` and `member` refers to ourselves.

       * A carbon-copy of a message received by another resource of our account
         which belongs to this conversation was received. `source` is
         :attr:`~.MessageSource.CARBONS` and `member` is the
         :class:`~.AbstractConversationMember` of the originator.

       * A carbon-copy of a message sent by another resource of our account was
         sent to this conversation. In this case, `source` is
         :attr:`~.MessageSource.CARBONS` and `member` refers to ourselves.

       Often, you donâ€™t need to distinguish between carbon-copied and
       non-carbon-copied messages.

       All messages which are not handled otherwise (and for example dispatched
       as :meth:`on_state_changed` signals) are dispatched to this event. This
       may include messages not understood and/or which carry no textual
       payload.

       `tracker` is set only for messages sent by the local member. If a
       message is sent from the client without tracking, `tracker` is
       :data:`None`; otherwise, the `tracker` is always set, even for messages
       sent by other clients. It depends on the conversation implementation as
       well as timing in which state a tracker is at the time the event is
       emitted.

    .. signal:: on_state_changed(member, new_state, msg, **kwargs)

       The conversation state of a member has changed.

       :param member: The member object of the member whose state changed.
       :type member: :class:`.AbstractConversationMember`
       :param new_state: The new conversation state of the member.
       :type new_state: :class:`~.ConversationState`
       :param msg: The stanza which conveyed the state change.
       :type msg: :class:`aioxmpp.Message`

       This signal also fires for state changes of the local occupant. The
       exact point at which this signal fires for the local occupant is
       determined by the implementation.

    .. signal:: on_presence_changed(member, resource, presence, **kwargs)

       The presence state of a member has changed.

       :param member: The member object of the affected member.
       :type member: :class:`~.AbstractConversationMember`
       :param resource: The resource of the member which changed presence.
       :type resource: :class:`str` or :data:`None`
       :param presence: The presence stanza
       :type presence: :class:`aioxmpp.Presence`

       If the `presence` stanza affects multiple resources, `resource` holds
       the affected resource and the event is emitted once per affected
       resource.

       However, the `presence` stanza affects only a single resource,
       `resource` is :data:`None`; the affected resource can be extracted from
       the :attr:`~.StanzaBase.from_` of the `presence` stanza in that case.
       This is to help implementations to know whether a bunch of resources was
       shot offline by a single presence (`resource` is not :data:`None`), e.g.
       due to an error or whether a single resource went offline by itself.
       Implementations may want to only show the former case.

       .. note::

          In some implementations, unavailable presence implies that a
          participant leaves the room, in which case :meth:`on_leave` is
          emitted instead.

    .. signal:: on_nick_changed(member, old_nick, new_nick, **kwargs)

       The nickname of a member has changed

       :param member: The member object of the member whose nick has changed.
       :type member: :class:`~.AbstractConversationMember`
       :param old_nick: The old nickname of the member.
       :type old_nick: :class:`str` or :data:`None`
       :param new_nick: The new nickname of the member.
       :type new_nick: :class:`str`

       The new nickname is already set in the `member` object, if the `member`
       object has an accessor for the nickname.

       In some cases, `old_nick` may be :data:`None`. These cases include those
       where it is not trivial for the protocol to actually determine the old
       nickname or where no nickname was set before.

    .. signal:: on_topic_changed(member, new_topic, **kwargs)

        The topic of the conversation has changed.

        :param member: The member object who changed the topic.
        :type member: :class:`~.AbstractConversationMember`
        :param new_topic: The new topic of the conversation.
        :type new_topic: :class:`.LanguageMap`

    .. signal:: on_uid_changed(member, old_uid, **kwargs)

        This rare signal notifies that the
        :attr:`~.AbstractConversationMember.uid` of a member has changed.

        :param member: The member object for which the UID has changed.
        :type member: :class:`~.AbstractConversationMember`
        :param old_uid: The old UID of the member.
        :type old_uid: :class:`bytes`

        The new uid is already available at the members
        :attr:`~.AbstractConversationMember.uid` attribute.

        This signal can only fire for multi-user conversations where the
        visibility of identifying information changes. In many cases, it will
        be irrelevant for the application, but for some use-cases it might be
        important to be able to re-write historical messages to use the new
        uid.

    .. signal:: on_enter()

        The conversation was entered.

        This event is emitted up to once for a :class:`AbstractConversation`.

        One of :meth:`on_enter` and :meth:`on_failure` is emitted exactly
        once for each :class:`AbstractConversation` instance.

        .. seealso::

            :func:`aioxmpp.callbacks.first_signal` can be used nicely to await
            the completion of entering a conversation::

                conv = ... # let this be your conversation
                await first_signal(conv.on_enter, conv.on_failure)
                # await first_signal() will either return None (success) or
                # raise the exception passed to :meth:`on_failure`.

        .. note::

            This and :meth:`on_failure` are the only signals which **must not**
            receive keyword arguments, so that they continue to work with
            :attr:`.AdHocSignal.AUTO_FUTURE` and
            :func:`~.callbacks.first_signal`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.10

    .. signal:: on_failure(exc)

        The conversation could not be entered.

        :param exc: The exception which caused the operation to fail.
        :type exc: :class:`Exception`

        Often, `exc` will be a :class:`aioxmpp.errors.XMPPError` indicating
        an error emitted from an involved server, such as permission problems,
        conflicts or non-existent peers.

        This signal can only be emitted instead of :meth:`on_enter` and not
        after the room has been entered. If the conversation is terminated
        due to a remote cause at a later point, :meth:`on_exit` is used.

        One of :meth:`on_enter` and :meth:`on_failure` is emitted exactly
        once for each :class:`AbstractConversation` instance.

        .. note::

            This and :meth:`on_failure` are the only signals which **must not**
            receive keyword arguments, so that they continue to work with

            :func:`~.callbacks.first_signal`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.10

    .. signal:: on_join(member, **kwargs)

       A new member has joined the conversation.

       :param member: The member object of the new member.
       :type member: :class:`~.AbstractConversationMember`

       When this signal is called, the `member` is already included in the
       :attr:`members`.

    .. signal:: on_leave(member, **kwargs)

       A member has left the conversation.

       :param member: The member object of the previous member.
       :type member: :class:`~.AbstractConversationMember`

       When this signal is called, the `member` has already been removed from
       the :attr:`members`.

    .. signal:: on_exit(**kwargs)

       The local user has left the conversation.

       When this signal fires, the conversation is defunct in the sense that it
       cannot be used to send messages anymore. A new conversation needs to be
       started.
