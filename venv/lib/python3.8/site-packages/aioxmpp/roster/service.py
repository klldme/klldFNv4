       The :class:`~aioxmpp.JID` of the entry. This is always a bare

class RosterClient(aioxmpp.service.Service):
    """
    A roster client :class:`aioxmpp.service.Service`.

    The interaction with a roster service happens mainly by accessing the
    attributes holding the state and using the events to be notified of state
    changes:

    Attributes for accessing the roster:

    .. attribute:: items

       A dictionary mapping :class:`~aioxmpp.JID` instances to corresponding
       :class:`Item` instances.

    .. attribute:: groups

       A dictionary which allows group-based access to :class:`Item`
       instances. The dictionaries keys are the names of the groups, the values
       are :class:`set` instances, which hold the :class:`Item` instances in
       that group.

       At no point one can observe empty :class:`set` instances in this
       dictionary.

    The :class:`Item` instances stay the same, as long as they represent the
    identical roster entry on the remote side. That is, if the name or
    subscription state are changed in the server side roster, the :class:`Item`
    instance stays the same, but the attributes are mutated. However, if the
    entry is removed from the server roster and re-added later for the same
    JID, it will be a different :class:`Item` instance.

    Signals:

    .. signal:: on_initial_roster_received()

       Fires when the initial roster has been received. Note that if roster
       versioning is used, the initial roster may not be up-to-date. The server
       is allowed to tell the client to re-use its local state and deliver
       changes using roster pushes. In that case, the
       :meth:`on_initial_roster_received` event fires immediately, so that the
       user sees whatever roster has been set up for versioning before the
       stream was established; updates pushed by the server are delivered using
       the normal events.

       The roster data has already been imported at the time the callback is
       fired.

       Note that the initial roster is diffed against whatever is in the local
       store and events are fired just like for normal push updates. Thus, in
       general, you wonâ€™t need this signal; it might be better to listen for
       the events below.

    .. signal:: on_entry_added(item)

       Fires when an `item` has been added to the roster. The attributes of the
       `item` are up-to-date when this callback fires.

       When the event fires, the bookkeeping structures are already updated.
       This implies that :meth:`on_group_added` is called before
       :meth:`on_entry_added` if the entry adds a new group.

    .. signal:: on_entry_name_changed(item)

       Fires when a roster update changed the name of the `item`. The new name
       is already applied to the `item`.

    .. signal:: on_entry_subscription_state_changed(item)

       Fires when a roster update changes any of the :attr:`Item.subscription`,
       :attr:`Item.ask` or :attr:`Item.approved` attributes. The new values are
       already applied to `item`.

       The event always fires once per update, even if the update changes
       more than one of the above attributes.

    .. signal:: on_entry_added_to_group(item, group_name)

       Fires when an update adds an `item` to a group. The :attr:`Item.groups`
       attribute is already updated (not only with this, but also other group
       updates, including removals) when this event is fired.

       The event fires for each added group in an update, thus it may fire more
       than once per update.

       The name of the new group is in `group_name`.

       At the time the event fires, the bookkeeping structures for the group
       are already updated; this implies that :meth:`on_group_added` fires
       *before* :meth:`on_entry_added_to_group` if the entry added a new group.

    .. signal:: on_entry_removed_from_group(item, group_name)

       Fires when an update removes an `item` from a group. The
       :attr:`Item.groups` attribute is already updated (not only with this,
       but also other group updates, including additions) when this event is
       fired.

       The event fires for each removed group in an update, thus it may fire
       more than once per update.

       The name of the new group is in `group_name`.

       At the time the event fires, the bookkeeping structures are already
       updated; this implies that :meth:`on_group_removed` fires *before*
       :meth:`on_entry_removed_from_group` if the removal of an entry from a
       group causes the group to vanish.

    .. signal:: on_entry_removed(item)

       Fires after an entry has been removed from the roster. The entry is
       already removed from all bookkeeping structures, but the values on the
       `item` object are the same as right before the removal.

       This implies that :meth:`on_group_removed` fires *before*
       :meth:`on_entry_removed` if the removal of an entry causes a group to
       vanish.

    .. signal:: on_group_added(group)

        Fires after a new group has been added to the bookkeeping structures.

        :param group: Name of the new group.
        :type group: :class:`str`

        At the time the event fires, the group is empty.

        .. versionadded:: 0.9

    .. signal:: on_group_removed(group)

        Fires after a new group has been removed from the bookkeeping
        structures.

        :param group: Name of the old group.
        :type group: :class:`str`

        At the time the event fires, the group is empty.

        .. versionadded:: 0.9

    Modifying roster contents:

    .. automethod:: set_entry

    .. automethod:: remove_entry

    Managing presence subscriptions:

    .. automethod:: approve

    .. automethod:: subscribe

    .. signal:: on_subscribe(stanza)

       Fires when a peer requested a subscription. The whole stanza received is
       included as `stanza`.

       .. seealso::

          To approve a subscription request, use :meth:`approve`.

    .. signal:: on_subscribed(stanza)

       Fires when a peer has confirmed a previous subscription request. The
       ``"subscribed"`` stanza is included as `stanza`.

    .. signal:: on_unsubscribe(stanza)

       Fires when a peer cancelled their subscription for our presence. As per
       :rfc:`6121`, the server forwards the ``"unsubscribe"`` presence stanza
       (which is included as `stanza` argument) *before* sending the roster
       push.

       Unless your application is interested in the specific cause of a
       subscription state change, it is not necessary to use this signal; the
       subscription state change will be covered by
       :meth:`on_entry_subscription_state_changed`.

    .. signal:: on_unsubscribed(stanza)

       Fires when a peer cancelled our subscription. As per :rfc:`6121`, the
       server forwards the ``"unsubscribed"`` presence stanza (which is
       included as `stanza` argument) *before* sending the roster push.

       Unless your application is interested in the specific cause of a
       subscription state change, it is not necessary to use this signal; the
       subscription state change will be covered by
       :meth:`on_entry_subscription_state_changed`.

    Import/Export of roster data:

    .. automethod:: export_as_json

    .. automethod:: import_from_json

    To make use of roster versioning, use the above two methods. The general
    workflow is to :meth:`export_as_json` the roster after disconnecting and
    storing it for the next connection attempt. **Before** connecting, the
    stored data needs to be loaded using :meth:`import_from_json`. This only
    needs to happen after a new :class:`Service` has been created, as roster
    services wonâ€™t delete roster contents between two connections on the same
    :class:`.Client` instance.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.8

       This class was formerly known as :class:`aioxmpp.roster.Service`. It
       is still available under that name, but the alias will be removed in
       1.0.

        entry is identified by its bare `jid`.

        the entry is re-used, if any.

        If the entry does not exist, it will be created on the server side.

        The `remove_from_groups` and `add_to_groups` arguments have to be based

        from the server for updating the data structures and firing events, to
        ensure that consistent state with other clients is achieved.
