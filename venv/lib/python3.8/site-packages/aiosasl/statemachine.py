class SASLInterface(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """
    This class serves as an abstract base class for interfaces for use with
    :class:`SASLStateMachine`. Specific protocols using SASL (such as XMPP,
    IMAP or SMTP) can subclass this interface to implement SASL on top of the
    existing protocol.

    The interface class does not need to implement any state checking. State
    checking is done by the :class:`SASLStateMachine`. The following interface
    must be implemented by subclasses.

    The return values of the methods below are tuples of the following form:

    * ``(SASLState.SUCCESS, payload)`` -- After successful
      authentication, success is returned. Depending on the mechanism,
      a payload (as :class:`bytes` object) may be attached to the
      result, otherwise, ``payload`` is :data:`None`.

    * ``(SASLState.CHALLENGE, payload)`` -- A challenge was sent by
      the server in reply to the previous command.

    * ``(SASLState.FAILURE, None)`` -- This is only ever returned by
      :meth:`abort`. All other methods **must** raise errors as
      :class:`SASLFailure`.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.4

       The first element of the returned tuples are now elements of
       :class:`SASLState`. For compatibility with previous versions of
       ``aiosasl`` the first elements of the string may be one of the
       strings ``"success"``, ``"failure"`` or "``challenge``". For
       more information see :meth:`SASLState.from_reply`.
